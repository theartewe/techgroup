  overview_text_p1:   "First, there was a seed, homegrown by the skillful hand. It was then nurtured by the humble mind which let it grow into a promising tree of inspiration, opportunity and success. Knowledge, skills, and sincere efforts subsequently developed the tree into a conglomerate in less than a decade – the Tech Group."
  overview_text_p2: 'A famous Arabic proverb goes "tall oaks grow from little acorns," or great things may come from small beginnings. The small enterprise that was founded nine years ago is now an aggregate of industries, mostly downstream and empowered by sheer dedication of its founder, managers, and human resources. It is an epic symbol, and a glowing torch of independent-thinking companies, competitive and respected in the indispensable fields in the industry – construction, real estate & development, vehicle maintenance, block manufacturing, ceramic tiles, woodworks, elevator systems, MEP, aluminum & glass, piling, steel, metal fabrications and transport.'

  ceo_message_p1: "Ali Ghaleb Jaber is one of the most respected businessmen in the UAE and the GCC block. While completing his university degree in Canada, he began to learn the nubs in manufacturing and technology. He started up as a trainee devoting his time and enthusiasm to learn all the facets in various operations and investments of the company. One of his strengths is explaining technological innovations. "
  ceo_message_p2: "Finally, he took the helm of Tech Group as Chief Executive Officer.
With his self-styled initiatives and exemplary leadership, the companies diversified into major manufacturing operations, and later claim the recognition as one of the most successful conglomerates in the UAE and GCC. Tech Group’s presence in the market has turned up a healthy competition in the manufacturing sector. "
  ceo_message_p3: "In August 2008, he was appointed Board Member and a major shareholder of the Kuwait-based Shiraa for Project Management. SPM is a closed shareholding Islamic company aimed to foster small businesses into specialized ventures in various business fields."
  ceo_message_p4: '"We will continue to cultivate a compelling economic model in the arena of small businesses, develop and support them by investing in these opportunities, facilitating any hurdles, and encouraging their growth in Kuwait and the GCC areas," Ali stresses.'
  ceo_message_p5: '"Our vision is to become a leading and a specializing company in fostering, supporting and substantiating the pervasive role of the small businesses sector in the economy through investing and making it a success story."'
  ceo_message_p6: "Ali continues to combine his vast experience in investments and manufacturing with his strong relationships with other industry leaders in the GCC. As an economist and investor, Ali also envisions the sharing of Tech Group’s wealth of experience throughout the Region. It now holds an office in Muscat (Oman), Kuwait City (Kuwait), Khartoum (Sudan), and Baghdad (Iraq). But for some other areas where the markets and opportunities are encouraging, it will just be a matter of time to build other roofs for Tech Group."
